//        ### Key Changes in This Fix:
//
//        1.  **New `findAvailableBranch()` Logic:** The logic is now much simpler and more direct:
//        * Is `Branch.NAIROBI` free? If yes, assign it. This will apply to the very first client that connects after the server starts.
//        * If `NAIROBI` is taken, loop through the *other* branches and assign the first one that is free.
//2.  **`isLocalConnection()` Removed:** This method is no longer necessary, as the new logic doesn't rely on the client's IP address.
//
//        Now, when you restart your server, the first client you run (which will be your `AdminCli`) is guaranteed to be assigned the `NAIROBI` branch, and you will be able to log in and use the admin functio
